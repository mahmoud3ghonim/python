## Pre-Commit Hooks

This repository uses **pre-commit hooks** to ensure high code quality and security before any code is committed to the repository.

### Why Use Pre-Commit Hooks?

Pre-commit hooks help to:

1. Automatically scan for **secrets** using **detect-secrets**.
2. Enforce **linting** rules to maintain consistent and high-quality code.

### Setting up Pre-Commit Hooks

To set up the pre-commit hooks, follow these steps:

**Install the necessary dependencies**:

```bash
pip install pre-commit detect-secrets
pre-commit install
